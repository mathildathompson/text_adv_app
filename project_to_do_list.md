#Project To Do List

###Bugs

* Deleteing a scene should redirect you to the current adventure
* Adding a track bombs out if a track description is not provided

###Must Have

* Add confirmation to deletes!
* Display 'Draft' adventures only for the creator, all users can see 'Published' adventures.
* Check validations on models and links to delete!!!
* Remove First Visit and Multi Visit options AND Remove Game Model
* Update FAQ page
* Prevent deletion of the opening scene - I have removed the link, but how to validate this?
* If a scene is flagged as the end, delete all tracks?
* Incorporate Bootstrap

###Nice to Have

* Setup Game 'so progress is tracked and scenes visited are tracked'
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no
* Prevent publishing an adventure if it has 'orphan scenes'
* Categories for adventures to filter
