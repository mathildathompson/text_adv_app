#Project To Do List

###Bugs



###Must Have

* Prevent deletion of the opening scene
* Prevent deletion of a scene if it has paths to other scenes??
* Link a scene to an existing scene (allow mutli paths)
* Add validations to models
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no

###Nice to Have

* Display a preview of each adventure when viewing
* Restrict users to only edit their own adventures
* Setup Game 'so progress is tracked and scenes visited are tracked'


###Ask Instructors

* For scenes, New and Edit are quite similar, how to fix this? Forms differ slightly (in how it posts)
* How best to link to the first scene
* Can I use Cancan to lock down permissions on modifying content
* Setup the relationship for a scene to find it's origins
