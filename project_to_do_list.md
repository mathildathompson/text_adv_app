#Project To Do List

###Must Have

* Automatically create an opening scene for a new adventure, prevent this from being deleted!
* Add a username to User model to display who created the adventure
* Add validations to models
* Flag the start point of an adventure (first link)
* Link a scene to an existing scene (allow mutli paths)
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no

###Nice to Have

* Display a preview of each adventure when viewing
* Restrict users to only edit their own adventures
* Setup Game 'so progress is tracked and scenes visited are tracked'


###Ask Instructors

* For scenes, New and Edit are quite similar, how to fix this? Forms differ slightly (in how it posts)
