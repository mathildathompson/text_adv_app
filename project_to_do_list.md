#Project To Do List

###Bugs



###Must Have

* Image upload via API
* Update FAQ page
* Fix the active highlighting on menu bar
* Prevent deletion of the opening scene - I have removed the link, but how to validate this?
* Validate username length! Minimum 8 chars with no spaces? Username must be unique!
* Prevent publishing an adventure if it has 'orphan scenes' or 'dead ends' AND remove editor options from published adventures AND prevent users from accessing adventures not published.

##Styling

* Style Sign in and Sign Up Forms
* Add placeholder text to forms
* Add Glyph Icons
* Set consistent page heading text and centre it

##Testing

* Retest user permissions !
* Check validations on models and links to delete!!!
* Changing user details

###Nice to Have

* Searching for an adventure
* Edit a Track (the description)
* Map an Adventure (Scene > Track Desc > Scene)
* Itemisation, track which scenes visited, save progress
* Add Categories for adventures to filter by interest
* Track how many plays an Adventure gets and list top adventures on the home page
