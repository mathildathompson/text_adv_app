#Project To Do List

###Bugs


###Must Have

* Image upload via API
* Split 'Adventures' link into two. 'Adventures' which includes PUBLISHED adventures only, and 'My Adventures' which shows all Adventures regardless of status.
* Update FAQ page
* Fix the active highlighting on menu bar
* Prevent deletion of the opening scene - I have removed the link, but how to validate this?
* Validate username length! Minimum 8 chars with no spaces? Username must be unique!

##Styling

* Style Form Errors with Bootstrap
* Add placeholder text to forms
* Add Glyph Icons

##Testing

* Retest user permissions !
* Check validations on models and links to delete!!!
* Changing user details

###Nice to Have

* Searching for an adventure
* Edit a Track (the description)
* Map an Adventure (Scene > Track Desc > Scene)
* Itemisation and Saving Progress
* Setup Game 'so progress is tracked and scenes visited are tracked'
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no
* Prevent publishing an adventure if it has 'orphan scenes'
* Categories for adventures to filter
* Track how many plays an Adventure gets and list top adventures on the home page
