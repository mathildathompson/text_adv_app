#Project To Do List

Must Have

* Multi-visit should default to Yes
* Add validations to models
* Flag the start point of an adventure (first link)
* Create a scene from a scene so they are automatically linked - this works but doesn't have the path.description populated
* Add Description to Adventure
* Link a scene to an existing scene
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no

Nice to Have

* Add an image to Adventures
* Restrict users to only edit their own adventures
