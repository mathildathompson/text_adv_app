###How to introduce game states?

Firstly, to play a game all users would have to be logged in.

When you click 'Play Adventure', the scene will be loaded that matches your game 'current scene'  
If you do not have a game for that adventure, a new game will be created.  
Reaching an end point will delete your game state  
If you load a scene that doesn't match your current game you're kicked out to the start of the adventure.

#Challenges

* Complex model! Scene > Track > Scene and back again
* User based permissions = Can only edit their own content. Only users who own the content can see it at all in draft status!
* State based permissions = Two states, draft and published. Prevent editing published adventures, prevent viewing of draft adventures.
* Menu bar highlighting being concise code!
* Complex Views (editors and players share the same pages!)
