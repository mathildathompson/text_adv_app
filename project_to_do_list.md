#Project To Do List

###Bugs


###Must Have

* Find my adventures rather than all adventures!
* Check that deleting an adventure deletes all scenes
* Validate so the first scene CANNOT be deleted.
* Display 'Draft' adventures only for the creator, all users can see 'Published' adventures.
* Check validations on models and links to delete!!!
* Remove First Visit and Multi Visit options AND Remove Game Model
* Update FAQ page
* Prevent deletion of the opening scene - I have removed the link, but how to validate this?
* If a scene is flagged as the end, delete all tracks

##Styling

* Style Form Errors with Bootstrap
* Add placeholder text to forms
* Add Glyph Icons

##Testing

* Retest user permissions !



###Nice to Have

* Edit an Track
* Map an Adventure (Scene > Track Desc > Scene)
* Itemisation and Saving
* Setup Game 'so progress is tracked and scenes visited are tracked'
* Track visited scenes, exclude scenes where multivisit = no
* Prevent publishing an adventure if it has 'orphan scenes'
* Categories for adventures to filter
